# APISocialNetwork

## Description

The Social Network API is a back-end application built with **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose ODM** to provide a robust API for a social network. This system allows users to:

- Create, read, update, and delete users and thoughts
- React to thoughts
- Add and remove friends from a userâ€™s friend list

This project demonstrates the power of a NoSQL database to handle large volumes of unstructured data efficiently.
